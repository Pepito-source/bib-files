@article{begaud-grimaud-2007-IMR32,
	abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common childhood solid tumor. Although spontaneous regression can occur in patients <1-year old, 70% of patients over the age of 1 year have a high-risk and difficult-to-treat NB. Cell type heterogeneity is observed either in the morphological appearance of NB tumors or in cell lines isolated from tumor specimens. NB consists of two principal neoplastic cell types: i) neuroblastic or N-type (undifferentiated cells); and ii) stromal or S-type (differentiated cells). As NB cells seem to have the capacity to differentiate spontaneously in vivo and in vitro, their heterogeneity could affect treatment outcome, in particular the response to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying process governing changes in differentiation in order to improve treatment response and NB patient outcome and the neoplastic population in IMR-32 represented a good model for such a study. Results showed that this cell line was extremely heterogeneous and highly variable in its stage of differentiation and we demonstrated that sedimentation field flow fractionation (SdFFF) permitted the isolation of 2 N-phenotypes and contributed to the understanding of the IMR-32 cell population dynamics. The first N-phenotype forms a pool of quiescent undifferentiated cells while the second one was able to proliferate (incorporation of BrdU) and also give rise to adherent S-type cells (PSA-N-CAM+ and N-CAM+). The results could also suggest a close interaction between these different cellular phenotypes to create the IMR-32 cell lineage.},

@article{dhillon-2015-dinutuximab,
	abstract = {United Therapeutics Corporation and the National Cancer Institute are
   developing dinutuximab (Unituxin (TM); ch14.18), a monoclonal antibody
   targeting GD2, for the treatment of neuroblastoma. GD2 is a glycolipid
   found on the surface of tumour cells, which is overexpressed in
   neuroblastoma. Dinutuximab, an IgG1 human/mouse chimeric switch variant
   of murine monoclonal antibody 14G2a, binds to GD2 and induces
   antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent
   cytotoxicity. The US FDA has recently approved the use of dinutuximab
   combination therapy for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in
   paediatric patients. The marketing authorization application for
   dinutuximab is under regulatory review in the EU, and phase I-III
   development is underway in several other countries. This article
   summarizes the milestones in the development of dinutuximab leading to
   this first approval for use (in combination with granulocyte macrophage
   colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2 and 13-cis retinoic acid) in
   the treatment of paediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who
   achieve at least partial response to prior first-line multiagent,
   multimodality therapy.},

@article{hobbie-2021-nb-irradiation,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. Those with high-risk disease are treated with multimodal therapy, including high-dose chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, radiation, and immunotherapy that have led to multiple long-term complications in survivors. In the late 1990s, consolidation therapy involved myeloablative conditioning including total body irradiation (TBI) with autologous stem cell rescue. Recognizing the significant long-term toxicities of exposure to TBI, more contemporary treatment protocols have removed this from conditioning regimens. This study examines an expanded cohort of 48 high-risk neuroblastoma patients to identify differences in the late effect profiles for those treated with TBI and those treated without TBI. PROCEDURE: Data on the study cohort were collected from clinic charts, provider documentation in the electronic medical record of visits to survivorship clinic, including all subspecialists, and ancillary reports of laboratory and diagnostic tests done as part of risk-based screening at each visit. RESULTS: All 48 survivors of BMT for high-risk neuroblastoma had numerous late effects of therapy, with 73% having between five and 10 late effects. TBI impacted some late effects significantly, including growth hormone deficiency (GHD), bone outcomes, and cataracts. CONCLUSION: Although high-risk neuroblastoma survivors treated with TBI have significant late effects, those treated without TBI also continue to have significant morbidity related to high-dose chemotherapy and local radiation. A multidisciplinary care team assists in providing comprehensive care to those survivors who are at highest risk for significant late effects.},

@article{kurowski-1998-nb-pgp,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) associated multidrug resistance for neuroblastoma patients is controversial. Therefore we asked whether at all the typical functional features of the multidrug resistance phenotype could be found in neuroblastoma cells and studied the prognostic relevance of Pgp expression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor touch preparations and tumor cell infiltrated bone marrow smears of 62 neuroblastoma patients were investigated. The expression of Pgp was determined by a highly sensitive immunosandwich technique. Drug resistance studies were performed by exposing cells to Pgp-dependent cytostatic drugs in tissue cultures. Intracellular drug accumulation was examined by rhodamine-123 fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Pgp expression was demonstrable for the SK-N-SH cell line, but not detectable in CHP-100 and ten other neuroblastoma cell lines by immunocytochemistry. In tissue cultures, SK-N-SH cells showed a relative resistance to vincristine and adriamycin (45.1 and 12.7-fold resp.) and reduced intracellular accumulation of rhodamine-123 which could be normalized by the Pgp blocker verapamil. Pgp expression was detected by immunocytochemistry in 14 out of 62 tumors (22.6%). No correlation was found to the stage of the disease (P = 0.33), histopathological grading (P = 0.82), N-myc oncoprotein expression (P = 0.76) or N-myc oncogene amplification (P = 0.20). Kaplan-Meier analysis of event free survival for stage 4 tumors revealed a weak trend of inferior survival for patients with Pgp positive tumors (log-rank analysis: P = 0.069). CONCLUSIONS: Though Pgp expression is detectable and functional in neuroblastoma cells, but its presence does not provide much information to the complex phenomenon of chemotherapy resistance in patients.},

@article{lee-2018-nb-MYCN,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study investigated the clinical significance of MYCN amplification within high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). METHODS: Medical records of 135 patients who were diagnosed with high-risk NB from 2004 to 2016 were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-one (38%) patients had MYCN amplified tumors, and the remaining 84 (62%) had nonamplified tumors. MYCN amplification was associated with abdominal primary site, less differentiated pathology, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), lower vanillylmandelic acid level, and larger primary tumor volume at diagnosis. MYCN amplification was associated with a better early response (faster reduction of primary tumor volume and NSE level). The proportion of patients in complete response or very good partial response after induction treatment was relatively higher in MYCN amplified tumors than in nonamplified tumors; however, all progressions during induction treatment occurred only in MYCN amplified tumors (P = 0.007). The time to progression was shorter (median 1.5 years vs. 1.9 years, P = 0.037) and survival after relapse/progression was worse in MYCN amplified tumors (3 year overall survival: 7.7 $\pm$ 7.4% vs. 20.5 $\pm$ 8.8%, P = 0.046). There was no difference in event-free survival and overall survival between MYCN amplified and nonamplified tumors. CONCLUSION: MYCN amplification was associated with more aggressive features at diagnosis and a better early response, but a higher progression rate during induction treatment and lower chance of survival after relapse/progression. There was no difference in survival rates according to MYCN amplification in patients with high-risk NB.},

Patients in North America are risk-stratified using a number of features including age at diagnosis, disease stage, tumor histology, MYCN status (amplified versus nonamplified), and tumor cell ploidy. In this paper, we review the evidence for utilizing these features in the risk classification of neuroblastic tumors. Additionally, we review the clinical and biologic criteria used by various cooperative groups to define low, intermediate, and high-risk disease populations in clinical trials, highlighting the differences in risk classification internationally. Finally, we discuss the development of the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group classification system, designed to begin worldwide standardization of neuroblastoma pretreatment risk classification and allow comparison of clinical trials conducted through different cooperative groups.},

Recent research has shed light on the biology of neuroblastoma, allowing for more accurate risk stratification and treatment reduction in many cases, although newer treatment strategies for children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma are needed to improve outcomes. Areas covered: Neuroblastoma epidemiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and recent advances in treatment of both newly diagnosed and relapsed neuroblastoma. Expert commentary: The identification of newer tumor targets and of novel cell-mediated immunotherapy agents may lead to novel therapeutic approaches, and clinical trials for regimens designed to target individual genetic aberrations in tumors are underway. A combination of therapeutic modalities will likely be required to improve survival and cure rates for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.},
