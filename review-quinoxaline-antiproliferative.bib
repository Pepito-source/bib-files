 title = {PTEN inhibition leads to the development of resistance to novel isoquinoline
      derivative TNBG-5602 in human liver cancer cells.},
 abstract = {TNBG-5602, a new synthesized derivative of tetrazanbigen, is a potential
      chemotherapeutic agent against cancer. However, its underlying mechanism is
      complex and still unknown. In this investigation, the anticancer effects of
      TNBG-5602 were determined in vitro and in vivo. Small RNA retroviral library
      plasmids that overexpress 19-bp fragments were used to generate
      TNBG-5602-resistant cells. After validation, the overexpressed 19-bp fragments
      were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the drug-resistant
      cells. Furthermore, the relationship of TNBG-5602, phosphatase and tensin homolog
      deleted on Chromosome 10 (PTEN), and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
      (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway was explored. The results showed that
      TNBG-5602 can effectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis
      in vitro and in vivo. Drug-resistant cells were screened using the small RNA
      library. Compared with naïve cells, drug-resistant cells were more resistant to
      TNBG-5602 in vitro and in vivo. NGS results revealed that the second highest
      overexpressed 19-bp fragment perfectly matched the PTEN gene, so the expression
      of PTEN in various cells and tissues was verified. Further research showed that
      exogenous overexpression of PTEN strengthened the anticancer effects of TNBG-5602
      on p-Akt expression, whereas silencing of PTEN weakened these effects in naïve
      cells. Taken together, by using this library, we confirmed that PTEN is the
      target gene to the anticancer effects of TNBG-5602 via the PI3K/Akt pathway.},
