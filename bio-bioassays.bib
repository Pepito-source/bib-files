	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of five different light-cured orthodontic bonding composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The orthodontic composites Heliosit Orthodontic (Ivoclar), Transbond XT (3M Unitek), Bisco ORTHO (Bisco), Light Bond (Reliance), and Quick Cure (Reliance) were prepared, and the samples were extracted in 3 mL of BME (Basal Medium Eagle) with 10\% newborn calf serum for 24 hours. The L929 cells were plated (25,000 cells/mL) in a 96-well dish and maintained in a humidified incubator for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5\% CO(2), and 95\% air. After 24 hours of incubation of the cells, the incubation medium was replaced by the immersed medium in which the samples were stored. Then, L929 cells were incubated in contact with eluates for 24 hours. The cell mitochondrial activity was evaluated by the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) test. Twelve wells were used for each specimen, and the MTT tests were applied two times. The data were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD tests. RESULTS: Results with L929 fibroblasts demonstrated that except for Transbond XT, freshly prepared composite materials did not reduce vital cell numbers (P > .05) compared with the control group. Our data demonstrate that Transbond XT showed significant cytotoxicity compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that tested orthodontic bonding composites are suitable for clinical application, but that further studies using different test methods are needed for Transbond XT.},

@article{alley-1988-MTT,
	abstract = {For the past 30 years strategies for the preclinical discovery and development of potential anticancer agents have been based largely upon the testing of agents in mice bearing transplantable leukemias and solid tumors derived from a limited number of murine as well as human sources. The feasibility of implementing an alternate approach, namely combined in vitro/in vivo screening for selective cytotoxicity among panels of human tumor cell lines derived from a broad spectrum of human solid tumors is under investigation. A group of 30 cell lines acquired from a variety of sources and representing 8 lung cancer pathologies as well as 76 cell lines representing 10 other categories of human cancer (carcinomas of colon, breast, kidney, prostate, ovary, head and neck; glioma; leukemia; melanoma; and sarcoma) have exhibited acceptable growth characteristics and suitable colorimetric profiles in a single, standard culture medium. Measurements of in vitro growth in microculture wells by cell-mediated reduction of tetrazolium showed excellent correlation (0.89 less than r2 less than 0.98) with measurements of cellular protein in adherent cell line cultures as well as viable cell count in suspension cell line cultures (0.94 less than r2 less than 0.99). Since the microculture tetrazolium assay provides sensitive and reproducible indices of growth as well as drug sensitivity in individual cell lines over the course of multiple passages and several months' cultivation, it appears suitable for initial-stage in vitro drug screening.},

@manual{assay-guidance-manual-2004,
	abstract = {This eBook is a comprehensive, crucial resource for investigators optimizing assays to evaluate collections of molecules with the overall goal of developing probes that modulate the activity of biological targets, pathways or cellular phenotypes. Such probes might be candidates for further optimization and investigation in drug discovery and development. Originally written as a guide for therapeutic project teams within a major pharmaceutical company, this manual has been adapted to provide guidelines for scientists in academic, non-profit, government and industrial research laboratories to develop assay formats compatible with High Throughput Screening (HTS) and Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) measurements of new and known molecular entities. Topics addressed in this manual include: Descriptions of assay formats that are compatible with HTS and determination of SAR. Selection and development of optimal assay reagents. Optimizations and troubleshooting for assay protocols with respect to sensitivity, dynamic range, signal intensity and stability. Adaptations of assays for automation and scaling to microtiter plate formats. Instrumentation . Sources of assay artifacts and interferences . Statistical validation of assay performance parameters. Secondary assays for chemical probe validation and SAR refinement. Data standards for reporting the results of screening and SAR assays. In vivo assay development and validation. Assay development and validation for siRNA-based high-throughput screens. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) manages the content of the Assay Guidance Manual with input from industry, academia and government experts. More than 100 authors from around the globe have contributed content to this free resource, which is updated quarterly with contributions by experienced scientists from multiple disciplines working in drug discovery and development worldwide.
