@article{swissadme,
	abstract = {To be effective as a drug, a potent molecule must reach its target in
   the body in sufficient concentration, and stay there in a bioactive form
   long enough for the expected biologic events to occur. Drug development
   involves assessment of absorption, distribution, metabolism and
   excretion (ADME) increasingly earlier in the discovery process, at a
   stage when considered compounds are numerous but access to the physical
   samples is limited. In that context, computer models constitute valid
   alternatives to experiments. Here, we present the new SwissADME web tool
   that gives free access to a pool of fast yet robust predictive models
   for physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness and
   medicinal chemistry friendliness, among which in-house proficient
   methods such as the BOILED-Egg, iLOGP and Bioavailability Radar. Easy
   efficient input and interpretation are ensured thanks to a user-friendly
   interface through the login-free website
   http://www.swissadme.ch.Specialists, but also nonexpert in
   cheminformatics or computational chemistry can predict rapidly key
   parameters for a collection of molecules to support their drug discovery
   endeavours.},

@article{jang-2014-TG2-structure,
	abstract = {Transglutaminase2 (TG2) is a multi-functional protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, differentiation, wound healing, and angiogenesis. The malfunction of TG2 causes many human disease including inflammatory disease, celiac disease, neurodegenerative diseases, tissue fibrosis, and cancers. Protein cross-linking activity, which is representative of TG2, is activated by calcium ions and suppressed by GTP. Here, we elucidated the structure of TG2 in complex with its endogenous inhibitor, GTP. Our structure showed why GTP is the optimal nucleotide for interacting with and inhibiting TG2. In addition, sequence comparison provided information describing the evolutionary scenario of GTP usage for controlling the activity of TG2.},

@article{hetenyi-2002-blind-docking,
	abstract = {Reliability in docking of ligand molecules to proteins or other targets is an important challenge for molecular modeling. Applications of the docking technique include not only prediction of the binding mode of novel drugs, but also other problems like the study of protein-protein interactions. Here we present a study on the reliability of the results obtained with the popular AutoDock program. We have performed systematical studies to test the ability of AutoDock to reproduce eight different protein/ligand complexes for which the structure was known, without prior knowledge of the binding site. More specifically, we look at factors influencing the accuracy of the final structure, such as the number of torsional degrees of freedom in the ligand. We conclude that the Autodock program package is able to select the correct complexes based on the energy without prior knowledge of the binding site. We named this application blind docking, as the docking algorithm is not able to "see" the binding site but can still find it. The success of blind docking represents an important finding in the era of structural genomics.},

However, compared to other programs in the AutoDock Suite, it lacks support for modeling specific features such as macrocycles or explicit water molecules. Here, we describe the implementation of this functionality in AutoDock Vina 1.2.0. Additionally, AutoDock Vina 1.2.0 supports the AutoDock4.2 scoring function, simultaneous docking of multiple ligands, and a batch mode for docking a large number of ligands. Furthermore, we implemented Python bindings to facilitate scripting and the development of docking workflows.

	abstract = {AutoDock Vina, a new program for molecular docking and virtual screening, is presented. AutoDock Vina achieves an approximately two orders of magnitude speed-up compared with the molecular docking software previously developed in our lab (AutoDock 4), while also significantly improving the accuracy of the binding mode predictions, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development. Further speed-up is achieved from parallelism, by using multithreading on multicore machines. AutoDock Vina automatically calculates the grid maps and clusters the results in a way transparent to the user.},
