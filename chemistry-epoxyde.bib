@article{hanssen-2020-epoxide-opening,
	abstract = {{We have quantum chemically analyzed the ring-opening reaction of the
   model non-symmetrical epoxide 2,2-dimethyloxirane under basic and acidic
   conditions using density functional theory at OLYP/TZ2P. For the first
   time, our combined activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital
   analysis approach have revealed the interplay of physical factors that
   control the regioselectivity of these chemical reactions. Ring-opening
   under basic conditions occurs in a regime of strong interaction between
   the nucleophile (OH-) and the epoxide and the interaction is governed by
   the steric (Pauli) repulsion. The latter steers the attack
   preferentially towards the sterically less encumbered C-beta. Under
   acidic conditions, the interaction between the nucleophile (H2O) and the
   epoxide is weak and, now, the regioselectivity is governed by the
   activation strain. Protonation of the epoxide induces elongation of the
   weaker (CH3)(2)C-alpha-O bond, and effectively predistorts the substrate
   for the attack at the sterically more hindered side, which goes with a
   less destabilizing overall strain energy. Our quantitative analysis
   significantly builds on the widely accepted rationales behind the
   regioselectivity of these ring-opening reactions and provide a concrete
   framework for understanding these indispensable textbook reactions.}},

@article{gomes-2020-epoxide-drugdesign,
	abstract = {Functional group modification is one of the main strategies used in drug discovery and development. Despite the controversy of being identified for many years as a biologically hazardous functional group, the introduction of an epoxide function in a structural backbone is still one of the possible modifications being implemented in drug design. In this manner, it is our intention to prove with this work that epoxides can have significant interest in medicinal chemistry, not only as anticancer agents, but also as important drugs for other pathologies. Thus, this revision paper aims to highlight the biological activity and the proposed mechanisms of action of several epoxide-containing molecules either in preclinical studies or in clinical development or even in clinical use. An overview of the chemistry of epoxides is also reported. Some of the conclusions are that effectively most of the epoxide-containing molecules referred in this work were being studied or are in the market as anticancer drugs. However, some of them in preclinical studies, were also associated with other different activities such as anti-malarial, anti-arthritic, insecticidal, antithrombotic, and selective inhibitory activity of FXIII-A (a transglutaminase). As for the epoxide-containing molecules in clinical trials, some of them are being tested for obesity and schizophrenia. Finally, drugs containing epoxide groups already in the market are mostly used for the treatment of different types of cancer, such as breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Other diseases for which the referred drugs are being used include heart failure, infections and gastrointestinal disturbs. In summary, epoxides can be a suitable option in drug design, particularly in the design of anticancer agents, and deserve to be better explored. However, and despite the promising results, it is imperative to explore the mechanisms of action of these compounds in order to have a better picture of their efficiency and safety.},
