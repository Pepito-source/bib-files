	abstract = {In the process of optimization, we developed a novel core skeleton of thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine via GK-13. The derivatives synthesized were shown to inhibit TGase 2 activity in cancer cells. Some of the hit compounds such as the arylethynyl group-coupled thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine derivatives were shown to exhibit promising activity for use as potential therapeutic small-molecules in renal cancer by inhibiting TGase 2 activity.},

@article{palem-2016-quinazolinones-antiproliferative,
	abstract = {A new series of novel quinazolinones with allylphenyl quinoxaline hybrids 9a-n were efficiently synthesized in good yields by the reaction of 3-allyl-2-methylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (5a-n) with bromophenyl)quinoxaline (8) utilizing Pd catalyzed Heck-cross coupling and evaluated for anti-proliferative activity against four cancer cell lines such as HeLa (cervical), MIAPACA (pancreatic), MDA-MB-231 (breast) and IMR32 (neuroblastoma). Compounds 9a, 9e, 9g and 9h exhibited promising anti-proliferative activity with GI50 values ranging from 0.06 to 0.2μM against four cell lines, while compounds 9e and 9k showed significant activity against HeLa and MIAPACA cell lines and compounds 9b, 9d, 9h and 9j showed selective potency against IMR32 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. This is the first report on the synthesis and in vitro anti-proliferative evaluation of E-2-(4-substituted)-3-(3-(4-(quinoxalin-2-yl)phenyl)allyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-ones (9a-n). Docking results indicate a sign of good correlation between experimental activity and calculated binding affinity (dock score), suggesting that these compounds could act as promising DNA intercalates.},

@article{reddy-2016-anticancer-agents,
	abstract = {A series of (Z)-1-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-3-(phenylamino)prop-2-en-1-one derivatives were synthesized and characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR, ESI-MS and HRMS. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against HT-29, PC-3, A549 and U87MG human tumor cell lines. Most of the synthesized compounds displayed potent growth inhibition selectively of A549 cancer cells and did not show significant toxicity to the non-cancerous HaCaT cells. Some of the representative compounds, particularly, 16, 22 and 28 exhibited potent growth inhibition with IC50 values in the range of 1.25-3.98 μM, which are comparable or even better than the standard chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that these compounds could effectively inhibit the migration ability of A549 cells. Flow-cytometry analysis revealed that the compounds treatment led to G2/M cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the compounds induced apoptosis in A549 cells through depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (DΨm) and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, suggesting their potential to act as promising lead compounds for the development of cancer chemotherapeutics.},
