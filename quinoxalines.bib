	abstract = {Backgroun/Methods: In attempt to develop new potent anti-tumor agents, a series of quinoxaline derivatives was designed and synthesized. The novel compounds were tested in vitro for their anti-proliferative activities against HePG-2, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines. Additionally, DNA binding affinities as well as DNA-top II inhibitory activities of the synthesized compounds were investigated as potential mechanism for anticancer activity. Compounds 13, 15, 16 and 19 exhibited good cytotoxicity activities against the three cell lines (IC50 ranging from 7.6 to 32.4 µM) comparable to that of doxorubicin (IC50 = 9.8 µM). RESULTS: Interestingly, the results of DNA binding and DNA-top II inhibition assays were in agreement with those of the cytotoxicity tests, where the most potent anticancer compounds showed good DNA binding affinities (IC50 ranging from 25.1 to 32.4 µM) and DNA-top II inhibitory activities (IC50 ranging from 6.4 to 15.3 µM) comparable to those of doxorubicin (IC50 = 28.1 and 3.8 μM, respectively). Furthermore, molecular docking studies were carried out for the new compounds in order to investigate their binding pattern with the prospective target, DNA-top II complex (PDB-code: 3qx3).},

@article{ghattass-2014-DCQ-hypoxia,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although tumor hypoxia poses challenges against conventional cancer treatments, it provides a therapeutic target for hypoxia-activated drugs. Here, we studied the effect of the hypoxia-activated synthetic quinoxaline di-N-oxide DCQ against breast cancer metastasis and identified the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (p53 wildtype) and MDA-MB-231 (p53 mutant) were treated with DCQ under normoxia or hypoxia. Drug toxicity on non-cancerous MCF-10A breast cells was also determined. In vitro cellular responses were investigated by flow cytometry, transfection, western blotting, ELISA and migration assays. The anti-metastatic effect of DCQ was validated in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: DCQ selectively induced apoptosis in both human breast cancer cells preferentially under hypoxia without affecting the viability of non-cancerous MCF-10A. Cancer cell death was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) independently of p53 and was inhibited by antioxidants. DCQ-induced ROS was associated with DNA damage, the downregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. In MCF-7, HIF-1α inhibition was partially via p53-activation and was accompanied by a decrease in p-mTOR protein, suggesting interference with HIF-1α translation. In MDA-MB-231, DCQ reduced HIF-1α through proteasomal-dependent degradation mechanisms. HIF-1α inhibition by DCQ blocked VEGF secretion and invasion in MCF-7 and led to the inhibition of TWIST in MDA-MB-231. Consistently, DCQ exhibited robust antitumor activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer mouse xenografts, enhanced animal survival, and reduced metastatic dissemination to lungs and liver. CONCLUSION: DCQ is the first hypoxia-activated drug showing anti-metastatic effects against breast cancer, suggesting its potential use for breast cancer therapy.},

Interestingly, the results of Topo II inhibition and DNA binding assays were consistent with that of the cytotoxicity data, where the most potent anti-proliferative derivatives exhibited good Topo II inhibitory activities and DNA binding affinities, comparable to that of doxorubicin. Moreover, the most active compound 25(a) caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induced apoptosis in Caco-2 cells.

@article{lee-2013-GK13,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2), a cross-linking enzyme, plays an important role in both pro-survival and anti-apoptosis during oncogenesis. For instance, TGase 2 induces NF-κB activation through I-κBα polymerization, which leads to the increase of pro-survival factors such as BCl-2. TGase 2 also suppresses apoptosis via depletion of caspase 3 and cathepsin D. Therefore, a specific TGase 2 inhibitor may become a very useful treatment for cancer showing high levels of TGase 2 expression. METHODS: By small-molecule library screening, we managed to locate a competitive TGase 2 inhibiting quinoxaline compound (GK13) from 50 other quinoxaline derivatives. The 50 compounds that were screened represent a thousand structurally diverse, potentially pharmaceutical heterocyclic compound libraries, including benzopyrans, oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and quinoxalines. By measuring GI50, TGI, and LC50 using SRB assay, GK13 was selected. RESULTS: In vitro enzyme kinetics using guinea pig liver TGase 2 showed that IC50 value was about 16.4 E-6 M. GK13 inhibits TGase 2-mediated I-κBα polymerization in a dose-dependent manner. LC50 of GK13 showed greater efficacy as 4.3E-4 M than LC50 of doxorubicin that showed efficacy as 3.87E-3 M in NCC72 composing 11 tissue origins and 72 cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: GK13 showed a possibility that quinoxaline derivatives may be effective for anti-cancer activity via TGase 2 inhibition.},

In the present study we evaluated the antibacterial of several phenyl substituted quinoxalines, quinazolines and 1,5-naphthyridines against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus and vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcusfaecalis. Some of the more active compounds against S. aureus were evaluated for their effect on FtsZ protein polymerization. Further studies were also performed to assess their relative bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities. The notable differences observed between nonquaternized and quaternized quinoxaline derivatives suggest that differing mechanisms of action are associated with their antibacterial properties.},

Among the 26 synthesized compounds reported in this article, we found that cinnamil 3l exhibited its inhibitory effect with an IC(50) value of 1.45 $\pm$ 0.98 μM, significantly higher than doxorubicin (8.5 $\pm$ 0.85 μM) against pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1). Additionally, cinnamil 3l (IC(50) 10.98 $\pm$ 3.63 μM) showed less cytotoxicity than doxorubicin to Hs68 cells (0.92 $\pm$ 1.11 μM). The colony formation assay demonstrated that 3l obviously decreased the PANC-1 cell viability, and Western blot assays confirmed that 3l markedly induced apoptosis of PANC-1 cells through Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase 3 signaling cascades. These results demonstrate that cinnamil 3l has great potential to be further developed as a promising chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Quinoxaline is a fused heterocycle ring template present in diverse pharmacophore and widely used in medicinal chemistry. Owing to its vast pharmaceutical profile, several quinoxalines analogous displayed their distinct pharmacological activities. In the last couple of years, researchers have established several quinoxalines analogous via green protocol, multi-component cascades, one-pot synthesis, and combinatorial pin-point approach using effective catalysts and reagents. It is being further researched to develop novel entities for the advantage of humankind. This insight focuses on the latest synthesis, advances of quinoxaline analogous, developed during the last decennial period (2010-2020). Herein, we review the synthesis of quinoxaline motifs, debating various facets of structure-activity relationship and their bioavailability.},

Its molecular formula is C8H6N2, formed by the fusion of two aromatic rings, benzene and pyrazine. It is rare in natural state, but their synthesis is easy to perform. In this review the State of the Art will be presented, which includes a summary of the progress made over the past years in the knowledge of the structure and mechanism of the quinoxaline and quinoxaline derivatives, associated medical and biomedical value as well as industrial value. Modifying quinoxaline structure it is possible to obtain a wide variety of biomedical applications, namely antimicrobial activities and chronic and metabolic diseases treatment.},

Quinoline scaffold plays an important role in anticancer drug development as their derivatives have shown excellent results through different mechanism of action such as growth inhibitors by cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, disruption of cell migration, and modulation of nuclear receptor responsiveness. The anti-cancer potential of several of these derivatives have been demonstrated on various cancer cell lines. In this review we have compiled and discussed specifically the anticancer potential of quinoline derivatives, which could provide a low-height flying bird's eye view of the quinoline derived compounds to a medicinal chemist for a comprehensive and target oriented information for development of clinically viable anticancer drugs.},
