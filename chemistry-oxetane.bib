	abstract = {Introduction of oxetan-3-yl and azetidin-3-yl groups into heteroaromatic bases was achieved by using a radical addition method (Minisci reaction). To demonstrate utility, the process was used to introduce an oxetane or azetidine into heteroaromatic systems that have found important uses in the drug discovery industry, such as the marketed EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, a quinolinecarbonitrile Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and the antimalarial hydroquinine.},

@article{pyo-2007-paclitaxel,
	abstract = {The stability of drug is a critical factor in quality control, drug efficacy, safety, storage, and production conditions. The rearrangement of paclitaxel, which involves opening of the oxetane ring and migration of acetyl group occurred on heating a powder of purified paclitaxel. Subsequently, the unusual migration of benzoyl groups progressed rapidly in organic solvents. These rearrangement derivatives were isolated carefully. The structures of the intermediate derivative A and the product derivative B were confirmed using (1)H NMR, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry. We proposed the rearrangement pathway here for the first time. Neither derivative exhibited bioactivity in SKOV3 (ovarian cancer) or MDA-MB-435 (breast cancer) cell culture assays.},

@article{wang-2000-oxetane-taxol,
	abstract = {Numerous structure-activity studies combining synthesis and bioassay have been performed for the anti-cancer drug Taxol. The four-membered D-ring, an oxetane, is one of four structural features regarded to be essential for biological activity. This proposition is examined by application of a Taxol-epothilone minireceptor, K(i) estimation for microtubule binding and docking of Taxol analogues into a model of the Taxol-tubulin complex. In this way, we evaluate the two characteristics considered responsible for oxetane function: (1) rigidification of the tetracyclic Taxol core to provide an appropriate framework for presenting the C-2, C-4, C-13 side chains to the microtubule protein and (2) service as a hydrogen-bond acceptor. An energy decomposition analysis for a series of Taxol analogues demonstrates that the oxetane ring clearly operates by both mechanisms. However, a broader analysis of four-membered ring containing compounds, C- and D-seco derivatives, and structures with no oxetane equivalent underscores that the four-membered ring is not necessary for Taxol analogue bioactivity. Other functional groups and ligand-protein binding characteristics are fully capable of delivering Taxol biobehavior as effectively as the oxetane D-ring. This insight may contribute to the design and development of novel anticancer drugs.},
