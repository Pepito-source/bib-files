      trials.},
 abstract = {The development of new treatments for generalized anxiety disorder increasingly
      has been sabotaged by a high placebo-response rate. As a consequence, and in
      contrast to the surge of approvals for new antidepressants, only one new
      anxiolytic has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the past
      15 years. This article presents a brief review of factors that contribute to the
      placebo response in treatment studies of generalized anxiety. Since anxiety is a
      normal emotion that is sensitive to a variety of life stresses, it is
      particularly difficult to achieve the primary goal of a clinical trial, which is
      to extract the &quot;signal&quot; of a drug effect from the &quot;noise&quot; of background
      fluctuations in symptoms. Data from the published literature and from the
      authors&#x27; research unit concerning placebo-response trends are reviewed.},

	Abstract = {Adjustment disorder with anxiety is defined as a clinically significant anxiety that occurs within 3 months after the onset of an identifiable psychological stressor. Recent studies indicate that this disorder is not uncommon and must be quickly identified and treated. However, few therapeutic trials have been done in relation with this disorder. According to the criteria set by DSM IV, 170 patients with a primary diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety have been enrolled in a double blind multicenter controlled trial. Patients were treated for 4 weeks with etifoxine (150-200 mg/d), or buspirone (15-20 mg/d). Also both etifoxine and buspirone show clinical efficacy and safety, the two treatments are not equivalent. The global improvement score and the efficacy index are significantly improved in the etifoxine group. These results show the interest of using etifoxine in the treatment of adjustment disorder with anxiety and should be confirmed by further studies.},
